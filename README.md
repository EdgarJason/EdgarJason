# Hi, I'm Edgar 👋

I'm a UI/UX Designer who started getting curious about what happens behind the scenes.  
Now I'm learning backend development and trying to build things that actually work, not just look good.

---

## 🧠 What I'm currently learning
- Backend development with **Flask**
- RESTful API design
- Authentication (JWT)
- Basic system & API architecture
- How frontend and backend really talk to each other

---

## 🛠 Tech & Tools
**Design**
- Figma
- Framer
- Zeplin
- Maze
- Design Systems
- UX Research & Usability

**Backend / Dev**
- Python
- Flask
- REST API
- JSON
- Git & GitHub
- Postman

---

## 🚀 What I like building
- Small backend projects for learning
- APIs for real use cases (auth, CRUD, pagination)
- Projects where **UX decisions meet technical constraints**

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Become comfortable building backend services
- Understand system design step by step
- Grow into a product-focused engineer with strong UX sense
